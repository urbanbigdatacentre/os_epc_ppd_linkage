# Linking Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) and and Land Registry Price Paid Data (PPD) with UPRN


This repository contains the code for OS short term project. This reserach aims to explore how easy it is to attribute UPRNs to address information, looking at two property datasets in England and Wales, one is Domestic EPCs and the other is Land Registry PPD.

## 1. Set up

The whole rearach are mainly conducted in R, with data inputs and outputs stored in a PostGIS database. Figure 1 displays the whole workflow.

**Figure 1.**  The overall workflow of this project

### 1.1 Create a new spatial database in PostgreSQL
This research created a new PostGIS database and named it as **os_ubdc** (https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/creating_db.html). Here, the password of postgres is assumed to be **654321**.
### 1.2 Set up the working directory for R
The process for setting the working directory is listed below:
- Create a directory named "OS_Data" on your D: drive.
- Create a sub-directory named "e90_ab_plus_csv_gb" in "OS_Data" folder.This e90_ab_plus_csv_gb folder stores OS AdddressBase Plus (AB_Plus_Data.csv).
- Create a sub-directory named "EPC" in "OS_Data" folder. This EPC folder stores whole list of Domestic EPC dataset.
- Create a sub-directory named "PPD" in "OS_Data" folder. This PPD folder stores Land Registry PPD(pp-complete.csv).
### 1.3 Read data in PostGIS database
Three datasets are need to read in PostGIS before conduct the data linakge work.This is achieve by running [Read_EPC.R](Read_EPC.R),[Read_OSadd.R](Read_OSadd.R) and [Read_PPD.sql](Read_PPD.sql).

For OS AddressBase Plus data in the PostGIS database, we further removed the uprn record which is the also a parentuprn in AddressBase dataset.

## 2. Run Data linkage process
The main data linkage process is conducted in R. Below we sepeate introduce the 
### 2.1 Attaching UPRN in Domestic EPCs
The tagging UPRN work for Domestic EPCs
